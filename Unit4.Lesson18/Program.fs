//todo: HOMEWORK 
//Create a simple rules engine over the filesystem example from the previous lesson.
//The engine should filter out files that donâ€™t pass certain checks, such as being over
//a specific file size, having a certain extension, or being created before a specific
//date. Have you ever created any rules engines before? Try rewriting them in the style
//we defined in this lesson.
